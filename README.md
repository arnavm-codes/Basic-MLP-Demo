## About MLP or Multi-Layered Perceptron
### MLP is a class of feedfroward Neural Networks, made up of 3 layers: input, hidden, output. Each neuron is connected to every neuron in the next layer.
- input layer : passes data foward.
- hidden layer/s : adds biases, weights and impliments activation function to introduce non-linearity.
- output layer: gives predictions.
  
## About Dataset
### In this demo, we're using the MNIST dataset from tensorflow.keras. This dataset has about 70000 greyscale images of handwritten numbers with labels; 60000 in training set and 10000 in testing set.
